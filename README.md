# Functionalities-of-autonomous-vehicles-using-semantic-segmentation-and-object-detection
The sub-domains of computer vision that we have chosen for our project are object detection and semantic segmentation. Object detection is to identify the location of objects and semantic segmentation is about assigning a label to every pixel in the image.

By this project we propose to develop a system which will be able to detect the objects and specify the path (or) directions in an image by implementing the sub-domains elaborated . So that by our project there would be some help in developing  a autonomous self driving car.<img width="2951" alt="image" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/76056833/156600412-baae5706-c374-4583-89de-db5b88188ad6.png">
