# Functionalities-of-autonomous-vehicles-using-semantic-segmentation-and-object-detection

To a large extent, the frequent occurrence of traffic accidents is caused by subjective reasons related to the driver, such as drunk, fatigue and incorrect driving operations. In recent years, the development of autonomous vehicles has gradually attracted the attention of researchers in related fields worldwide. Avs can intelligently help humans perform driving tasks based on real-time traffic information, thereby indicating their significance in improving the safety of automobile driving and liberating human beings from tedious driving environments. Lane detection is an important foundation in the course of intelligent vehicle development that directly affects the implementation of driving behaviours. Based on the driving lane, determining an effective driving direction for the smart car and providing the accurate position of the vehicle in the lane are possible; these features contribute significantly towards improving the efficiency and driving safety of automatic driving. we also use object detection here to perceive environmental and surrounding threats such as oncoming vehicles or obstacles.

The sub-domains of computer vision that we have chosen for our project are object detection and semantic segmentation. Object detection is to identify the objects and semantic segmentation is about assigning a label to every pixel in the image.
