# Functionalities-of-autonomous-vehicles-using-semantic-segmentation-and-object-detection

The sub-domains of computer vision that we have chosen for our project are object detection and semantic segmentation. Object detection is to identify the location of objects and semantic segmentation is about assigning a label to every pixel in the image.
